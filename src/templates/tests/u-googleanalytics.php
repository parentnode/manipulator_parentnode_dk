	<h1>Google Analytics test</h1>
	<p>
		Admittedly this is not a fun test! You'll need to check the Google Analytics 
		account for manipulator.parentnode.dk to see if the values register correctly. 
		Remember to use the Real-Time events overview as the regular view will display event will a long delay.
	</p>
	<p>
		Invoke the event-dispatchers below as indicated. On the swipe-test, you have to swipe in all 4 directions before the test is completed.
		If the tracking is sent correctly, the line turns green - If not something is wrong.
