	<h1>If manipulation is required ...</h1>
	<p>
		Manipulator 0.8 is now available for <a href="/download">download</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Manipulator is an extremely flexible, performance optimized 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_library" target="_blank">JavaScript library</a>
		with a slightly neurotic focus on details.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is designed to mimic regular JavaScript, and utilize and extend the DOM objects instead of inventing new
		objects. Work WITH the DOM and take back control of your interface. Keep it close to native JavaScript
		to boost performance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Manipulator library provides an extensive set of name spaced cross-device shorthand functions, written 
		to utilize the the best performance option available - without inventing new concepts or abiding
		old implementation flaws.
	</p>
	<p>
		Have you ever tried building clean JavaScript/CSS3 for just WebKit 533+? This is very similar, with IE6 support.
	</p>

	<h2>The goal behind designing the Manipulator library</h2>
	<p>
		The Manipulator library has be developed with the following priorities:
	</p>
	<ul class="goal">
		<li>Using the newest standards</li>
		<li>Support for all devices</li>
		<li>Performance optimized in all possible ways</li>
		<li>Leveraging standard JavaScript knowledge - not changing the way you write JavaScript</li>
		<li>Providing a solution to common cross-device/cross-browser problems</li>
		<li>Simplifying implementation and backend development</li>
		<li>Fast, compatible and reliable</li>
		<li>Completely modular with no unnecessary overhead</li>
	</ul>
