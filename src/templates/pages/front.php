	<h1>If manipulation is required ...</h1>
	<p>
		Manipulator 0.8 is now available for <a href="/download">download</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Manipulator is an extremely flexible, performance optimized JavaScript
		library with a slightly neurotic focus on details.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is designed to mimic regular JavaScript, and utilize the DOM objects instead of inventing new ones. 
		Work WITH the DOM and take back control of your interface.
	</p>
	<p>
		The JavaScript library provides an extensive set of namespaced cross-device shorthand functions. These functions
		have been written to utilize the the best performance option available - without inventing new concepts or abiding
		old implementation flaws.
	</p>
	<p>
		Have you ever tried building clean JavaScript/CSS3 for just WebKit 533+? This is it, with IE6 support.
	</p>

	<h2>The goal behind designing the Manipulator library</h2>
	<p>
		The Manipulator library has be developed with the following priorities:
	</p>
	<ul class="goal">
		<li>Using the newest standards</li>
		<li>Support for all devices</li>
		<li>Performance optimized in all possible ways</li>
		<li>Leveraging standard JavaScript knowledge - not changing the way you write JavaScript</li>
		<li>Providing a solution to common cross-device/cross-browser problems</li>
		<li>Simplifying implementation and backend development</li>
		<li>Fast, compatible and reliable</li>
		<li>Completely modular with no unnecessary overhead</li>
	</ul>
